# Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### P0: SQLite Database ✓
- Created `meetings.db` with state tracking
- States: DISCOVERED → PROCESSING → DOWNLOADING → UPLOADING → UPLOADED → DIARIZING → DIARIZED
- Indexes on state and date for efficient queries

### P1: Split Scripts ✓
- `discover.js`: Polls calendar API, inserts new meetings
- `process.js`: Downloads video, extracts agenda, uploads to YouTube
- Clean separation of concerns

### P2: BullMQ Queue + Redis ✓
- Redis via Docker Compose for persistence
- BullMQ with exponential backoff retries
- Worker processes jobs sequentially
- Queue monitoring and metrics

### P3: Object Store Helpers ✓
- Deterministic paths via `storage/paths.js`
- Organized into `raw/` and `derived/` directories
- Future-proofed for S3 migration

### P4: Structured JSON Logging ✓
- All scripts output JSON logs
- Includes meeting_id, step, timestamps
- Ready for Loki/Grafana ingestion

### P5: Systemd Timer ✓
- Hourly discovery with flock protection
- Worker service with auto-restart
- Proper user isolation and permissions

### P6: Back-fill CLI ✓
- `backfill.js` with intelligent throttling
- Monitors queue depth
- Batch processing support
- Dry-run mode for testing

### P7: GPU Diarization Skeleton ✓
- `diarize-worker.js` ready for WhisperX
- Automatic enqueueing after upload
- GPU device selection support
- Separate systemd service

### P8: Cleanup ✓
- Removed --force flag dependencies
- Migration script for legacy data
- Clear separation of old/new code

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Database state prevents duplicate work
2. **Scalability**: Queue allows multiple workers
3. **Observability**: JSON logs + queue metrics
4. **Maintainability**: Clean module separation
5. **Idempotency**: Can restart at any point

## Next Steps (Horizon 2+)

- Deploy Loki + Grafana for log aggregation
- Implement WhisperX Docker image
- Add S3 storage backend
- Multi-city support
- Custom video platform
