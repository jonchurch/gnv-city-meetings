# Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### P0: SQLite Database ✓
- Created `meetings.db` with state tracking
- States: DISCOVERED → DOWNLOADING → PROCESSING → UPLOADING → UPLOADED → DIARIZING → DIARIZED
- Indexes on state and date for efficient queries
- State machine workflow with automatic transitions

### P1: Split Scripts ✓
- `discover.js`: Polls calendar API, inserts new meetings, enqueues for processing
- Specialized workers for each processing step:
  - `download-worker.js`: Downloads videos using yt-dlp
  - `extract-worker.js`: Extracts agendas and generates chapters
  - `upload-worker.js`: Uploads to YouTube with playlists
  - `diarize-worker.js`: Transcribes audio (GPU-based)
- Clean separation of concerns with workflow orchestration

### P2: BullMQ Queue + Redis ✓
- Redis via Docker Compose for persistence
- Multiple specialized queues: download, extract, upload, diarize
- BullMQ with exponential backoff retries
- Worker-based architecture with automatic job progression
- Queue monitoring and metrics

### P3: Object Store Helpers ✓
- Deterministic paths via `storage/paths.js`
- Organized into `raw/` and `derived/` directories
- Future-proofed for S3 migration
- Support for multiple file types (video, metadata, chapters)

### P4: Structured JSON Logging ✓
- All scripts output JSON logs
- Includes meeting_id, step, timestamps
- Ready for Loki/Grafana ingestion
- Consistent logging across all workers

### P5: Systemd Services ✓
- Hourly discovery timer with flock protection
- Dedicated systemd services for each worker type
- Auto-restart and proper user isolation
- Production-ready deployment configuration

### P6: Back-fill CLI ✓
- `backfill.js` with intelligent throttling
- Monitors queue depth across all queues
- Batch processing support
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Uses discovery service for consistent behavior

### P7: GPU Diarization Worker ✓
- `diarize-worker.js` ready for WhisperX integration
- Automatic enqueueing after upload completion
- GPU device selection support
- Separate systemd service for resource isolation

### P8: Cleanup & Legacy Removal ✓
- Removed monolithic `worker.js` and `process.js`
- Clean state machine architecture
- Optional cleanup job for disk space management
- Migration script for legacy data

### Enhanced CLI Tools ✓
- Replaced manual argument parsing with Node.js `util.parseArgs`
- Comprehensive help text and short flags for all scripts
- Consistent user experience across all CLI tools
- Removed confusing legacy options

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Reliability**: State machine prevents duplicate work and ensures consistent progression
2. **Scalability**: Multiple specialized workers can run independently
3. **Observability**: JSON logs + queue metrics + state tracking
4. **Maintainability**: Clean worker separation with workflow orchestration
5. **Idempotency**: Can restart at any point, workers handle their own state transitions
6. **Flexibility**: Each processing step is independent and can be scaled separately
7. **User Experience**: Robust CLI tools with proper argument parsing and help text

## Current Architecture

### State Machine Workflow
```
DISCOVERED → download-worker → DOWNLOADED
DOWNLOADED → extract-worker → EXTRACTED  
EXTRACTED → upload-worker → UPLOADED
UPLOADED → diarize-worker → DIARIZED
```

### Components
- **Discovery Service**: Finds meetings and starts workflow
- **Workflow Orchestrator**: Manages state transitions between workers
- **Specialized Workers**: Each handles one step and advances to next
- **Queue System**: BullMQ/Redis for reliable job processing
- **Database**: SQLite for state tracking and meeting metadata
- **Storage**: Deterministic file paths ready for S3 migration

## Next Steps (Horizon 2+)

- Deploy Loki + Grafana for log aggregation
- Implement WhisperX Docker image
- Add S3 storage backend
- Multi-city support
- Custom video platform
